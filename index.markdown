title: PHP based torrent file creator, tracker and seed server
description: With PHPTracker you are able to reduce your bandwith costs using the Bittorrent technology. If you serve big files, you have to give access from your server only initially.

**Serving big files? Out of bandwith? Out of money?**

We have a solution. Let your users take advantage of the Bittorrent protol to download your files and relax your connection while saving money!
PHPTracker is an all-in-one solution for you. It is capable of:

* creating standard .torrent files from any file on your server
* tracking client peers and managing peer announcements
* initially seeding your file with a peer daemon which automatically shuts down once you have enough external seeders!</li>

Why PHPTracker is different? Because it's not "just a tracker", it contains a seeder server too so the distribution of your files is automatic. This is a big step for the content providers to adapt this amazing technology and change the stereotype that "torrent = warez".

See requirements page to see how little you need to set it up (you probably already have all).
